# Swift_ToO

Triggering and analyzing Swift UVOT follow-ups for ZTF sources of interest.

## Software prerequisites

- [HEASoft](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/lheasoft/)

- [The HEASARC Calibration Database (CALDB)](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/caldb/caldb_intro.html)

## Environment setups

You will need to correctly set the `HEAsoft` and `CALDB` paths in a `HEAsoft_env` file for all the `HEAsoft` methods to function. See `HEAsoft_env_ex` for an example.

## Usage

### Submit a ToO request

```shell
python UVOT_ToO.py
```

to enter the interactive environment and fill in the request form.

### Query data

```shell
python UVOT_Fetch.py --name "SN_NAME" --targetid "TARGET_ID"
```

Data from each observation will be stored in `./data/SN_NAME/`.

### Photometry

```shell
python UVOT_Phot.py --name "SN_NAME"
```

To begin with, you will need to visually inspect the image and decide the source and sky background regions to be used in the aperture photometry. The two regions should be stored in `src.reg` andÂ `bkg.reg` under the `./data/SN_NAME/` directory, following the syntax below

```
fk5;circle(RA [deg], dec [deg], radius'' [arcsec])
```

> TODO: create an interactive script to generate the region files automatically.

The Python script will automatically do photometry for every single exposure in UVOT sky images/exposure maps and generate a `FITS` image for each filter in `./data/SN_NAME/OBS_ID/uvot/image/` called `FILTER_maghist.out`. If there are multiple exposures in one image, all of which have SNR < 5, the script will stack all the exposures and obtain the source flux from the stacked image.

Then with a second run, the multi-band aperture photometry results will be stored in `./data/SN_NAME/OBS_ID/uvot/image/FILTER_stacked.out`.

### Light curves

```shell
python UVOT_LightCurve.py --name "SN_NAME"
```

This script will first try to read the `*_stacked.out` files. If they do not exist, which means the images are not stacked, it will then read the `*_maghist.out` files for single exposures.

## Known issues

1. In `UVOT_Fetch.py`, in case of
   
   ```python
   tqdm.std.TqdmKeyError: "Unknown argument(s): {'display': False}"
   ```
   
   you may need to comment out the following lines in `tqdm/std.py`
   
   ```python
   raise (
       TqdmDeprecationWarning(
           "`nested` is deprecated and automated.\n"
           "Use `position` instead for manual control.\n",
           fp_write=getattr(file, 'write', sys.stderr.write))
       if "nested" in kwargs else
       TqdmKeyError("Unknown argument(s): " + str(kwargs)))
   ```

2. In `UVOT_Phot.py`, in case of
   
   ```
   CALDBCONFIG environment variable not properly set (at HDgtcalf.c: 609)
   Problem getting CALDB index file (at HDgtcalf.c: 77)
   ```
   
   you may need to change the definition of `$CALDBCONFIG` and `$CALDBALIAS` in `$CALDB/software/tools/caldbinit.sh` or `$CALDB/caldbinit.sh` to match the local installation. As you see, the path to `caldbinit.sh` can also vary from machines to machines.
